# **Third Issue** #
More information about the issue and the final report can be found [here](3rd-Issue/3rd-Issue.pdf). **This issue consists of two parts.**

## Part A ##
In this part we were asked to create a query whose results are in cube format. CUBE is an extension of the GROUP BY clause
and it will generate subtotals for all combinations of grouping columns specified in the GROUP BY. For our created query the specified dimensions were 
`severity`, `road_surface_conditions` and `vehicle_type`.

## Part B ##
In this part we dealt with the assumption that our DBMS does not support the CUBE operator for creating the cube above, nor the GROUP BY GROUPING SETS statement, but only the GROUP BY statement. 
We were asked to overcome this difficulty and end up with the same output. 

### The full report and the actions made to give the solution can be found [here](3rd-Issue/3rd-Issue.pdf) and the SQL code [here](3rd-Issue/src).
