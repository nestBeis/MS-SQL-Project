# **Second Issue** #

In this issue we were asked to retrieve catalogues of data from our Database by creating 5 SQL Queries.
More specifically, the concept was that the Monistry of Transport wanted to retrieve a list of accidents or reports based on specific instructions. These instructions can be seen below:

## Ministry's demands ##
1. _Display a list with the number of accidents per year and accident severity. The list should be sorted by year in descending order._
2. _Display a list with the number of fatal accidents and the total number of casualties by gender and age of the responsible driver._
3. _Display a list with an analysis of the number of accidents based on the road surface conditions and the severity of the accident._
4. _Display a list with the number of accidents and the number of casualties per year and vehicle type that caused the accident. The list should only calculate for accidents involving more than 2 vehicles._
5. _The ministry's management wants a report that will contain the following information:_
   * _The total number of accidents, the total number of vehicles involved in any accident, and the total number of victims during the decade (2005 to 2015)._
   * _The number of accidents, the number of vehicles involved in an accident, and the number of victims on an annual basis._
   * _The number of accidents, the number of vehicles involved in an accident, and the number of victims per quarter and month for each year._

### The SQL queries that genetares the above reports are into the `requested_queries.sql` file. ###
